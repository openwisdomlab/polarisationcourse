# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-20)

**Core value:** Students voluntarily immerse in exploration for 2+ hours -- curiosity-driven discovery learning where polarization knowledge is a natural byproduct of exploring the world
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation & Minimum Viable Scene

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 phases derived from 37 requirements -- Foundation, Interaction, Multi-Region, Depth, Polish
- [Roadmap]: One-scene-first strategy to break 5-iteration rewrite cycle -- Phase 1 delivers a single playable isometric environment
- [Revision]: 2D isometric primary, minimize 3D -- SVG/CSS/Framer Motion for world, Canvas/WebGL only for beam glow effects if needed
- [Revision]: Click/tap navigation replaces WASD free camera -- Monument Valley interaction model
- [Revision]: Removed three.js upgrade requirement (TECH-02) -- replaced with isometric geometry system requirement

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Isometric coordinate system design -- need consistent mapping between visual isometric space and interaction hit-targets
- [Research]: SVG beam rendering performance -- animated SVG paths with real-time physics updates need profiling to confirm 60fps target
- [Research]: Discovery-without-scaffolding balance requires playtesting -- cannot be fully designed upfront
